# VYTALity
A DPLL SAT solver with unit propadation. Created as the final assignment for the VYTAL subject I took @ UPOL.

Based on the [Wikipedia DPLL algorithm page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm) and this [DPLL algorithm breakdown](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/james.worrell/lecture06.pdf) by Oxford Department of Computer Science.
